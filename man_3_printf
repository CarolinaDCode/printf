.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "holberton.h"

.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
The _printf function prints a message to standard output under a string that specifies how the arguments for standard output are converted.

.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string and is made up of zero or more directives, the ordinary characters (not%); which they copy to the output stream. Each conversion specification is entered by the% character and ends with a conversion specifier, in between these two there can be zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width, an optional precision, and an optional length modifier.

The general syntax of a conversion specification is:

    %[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion

.SH Return value
After a successful return, the _prinft function returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to finalize the output of strings.
If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH The conversion specifier
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied.
The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

.TP
.BR c
Prints a single character, in the case of having int as an argument it becomes an unsigned character, then the resulting character is written

.TP
.B s
prints a string of characters.
Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified are written.

.TP
.B %
Print a '%' only in the case of passing '%%', in case of being only '%' no.

.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.

.TP
.B b
The unsigned int argument is converted to binary.

.TP
.B o, u x, X
The unsigned int argument is converted to unsigned octal (o), unsigned decimal (u), or unsigned hexadecimal (x and X) notation. The letters abcdef are used for x
conversions; the letters ABCDEF are used for X conversions.

.TP
.B S
Prints a string of characters. Non printable characters (0 < ASCII value < 32 or >= 127) are printed this way: \x, followed by the ASCII code value in hexadecimal (upper case - always 2 characters).
